with my experience with LearningGit, i should not spend too much time for TestNG, primarily becasue i have used Nunit earlier.
  Create an exercise branch for this repository, create a simple project (no necessariliy a selenium project) which demonstrate basics of it and  advantages of TestNG over other unit test framework.
