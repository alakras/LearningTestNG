This is POC to create a TestNG.XML file similar to present in this folder in Eclipse, this proves below concepts

how to pass parameters from TestNG XML file to test script/ test class

9-Oct-20

1. we can run the testng test through an XML file, XML file will have referencde of the test class.

Question was 
from where to get this XML and where to put in project strucutre
We can get it from and it need to be put under src/test/resoruces, you can create a folder and keep it there, like we have two folder here Regression and sanity and have XML for those tests underneath.

I had created a source folder underwhich created an XML, 

Parameterization of values was an important aspect to learn which is one of the advantage of using TestNG

when i searched on google it looks like to read xml file parameters we need to use some libraries but if we are using TestNG it take cares of it.

got a good link, where it is very streight forward, however in actual project i can see map is used for this and it routes from multiple places but i think it would be there for some good reason of isolation
